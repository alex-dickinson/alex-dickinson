<!-- I am a Postdoc in the [EarthByte Group](http://www.earthbyte.org) at the [University of Sydney, School of Geosciences](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-geosciences.html).
I am interested in the inversion of thermochemical properties of the lithosphere subject to available geophysical data and their uncertainties.
Inversions that couple multiple datasets ultimately improve the precision and understanding of the thermochemical evolution of the Earth.
My expertise lies in Bayesian statistics applied to spatial and spatio-temporal data analysis, and in integrating numerical solid Earth evolution models with observations to constrain crustal evolution.

<!-- I am passionate about open source software :raised_hands: Check out my repositories below where source code is available with examples of how to reproduce peer-reviewed benchmarks and published results. You will also find code snippets that I have found useful - and maybe you will too! :thumbsup: -->

I'm a data scientist with knowledge of several scientific fields. I build computational tools, focusing on oceanography & renewable energy. I have a PhD in geophysics, I like to write, and I love working with others.

For details of my scientific work, see my profiles on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex-Dickinson) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Aujv9qYAAAAJ&hl=en).
