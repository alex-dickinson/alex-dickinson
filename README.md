I'm a data scientist with knowledge of a broad range of scientific fields. I currently work at the Ministry of Justice as an advisor on improving modelling and analysis of government datasets. I previously worked as a research scientist, focussing on geophysical sensing, geothermal energy and physical oceanography.
